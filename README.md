# Data Analysis on Sale_Data CSV File

**Objective:** Analyze sales data using Python and Pandas, and visualize insights with charts.

---

##  Objective
Perform basic data analysis on a CSV file to extract insights such as total revenue, profit, and units sold, grouped by different categories.  
Generate visualizations (bar charts) to represent these insights.

---

##  Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

---

##  Files in this Repository
- **task5.ipynb** → Jupyter Notebook containing:
  - CSV loading
  - Data cleaning
  - Grouped analysis using `groupby()`, `sum()`, and `plot()`
  - Bar chart visualizations
- **sales_data.csv** → Dataset used for analysis
- **README.md** → This documentation

##  Analysis Performed
1. **Total Revenue by Region**  
   - Grouped data by `Region` and summed `Total Revenue`.
   - Visualized results using a bar chart.

2. **Total Profit by Item Type**  
   - Grouped data by `Item Type` and summed `Total Profit`.
   - Visualized results using a bar chart.

3. **Units Sold by Country**  
   - Grouped data by `Country` and summed `Units Sold`.

##  How to Run
1. Download the repository files.
2. Open `task5.ipynb` in **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**.
3. Run all cells to:
   - Load the CSV file
   - Perform data analysis
   - View charts
